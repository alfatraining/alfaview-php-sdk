# alfaview PHP SDK

This package contains the compiled protobuf definitions for interacting with alfaview's backend services.

## Installation

The library is not on Packagist yet so you'll need to add the following repository to the `composer.json` file:

```json
  "repositories": [
    {
      "url": "https://github.com/alfatraining/alfaview-php-sdk.git",
      "type": "git"
    }
  ],
  "require": {
    "alfatraining/alfaview-php-sdk": "~1.0"
  }
```

Then do a `composer install` and you're done.
