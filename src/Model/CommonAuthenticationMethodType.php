 * @category Class
 * @description AuthenticationMethodType reports which authentication method was used to create an AccessToken.   - UNDEFINED_AUTH_METHOD: * UNDEFINED_AUTH_METHOD is the uninitialized default and must be considered invalid by all services.  - ACTIVATION_TOKEN: * ACTIVATION_TOKEN indicates that the access token was created during user sign-up. Deprecated: This kind of access token is no longer returned anywhere.  - AUTHORIZATION_CODE: * AUTHORIZATION_CODE indicates that the access token was created using AuthorizationCodeCredentials (i.e. API Keys) (see authService/authenticationService.proto).  - COMPANY_SWITCH: * COMPANY_SWITCH indicates that the access token was created by performing a company switch.  - GUEST_ACCESS: * GUEST_ACCESS indicates that the access token was created by authenticating via a guest or group link.  - LDAP: * LDAP indicates that the access token was created by authenticating via an external LDAP server.  - EXTERNAL: * EXTERNAL indicates that the access token was created by authenticating via an external identity provider.  - USERNAME_PASSWORD: * USERNAME_PASSWORD indicates that the access token was created by authenticating via a username and a password.  - PASSWORD_RESET: * PASSWORD_RESET is used in requests for password resets. Deprecated: tokens with this auth type were returned from auth V1, but will not be returned from auth V2.  - INTERNAL_SERVICE: * INTERNAL_SERVICE is only used for internal services. A regular user&#39;s access token must not use this method.  - DIAL_IN_CODE: * DIAL_IN_CODE indicates that the access token was created by authenticating via a dial-in code as a guest.
